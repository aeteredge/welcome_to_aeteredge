## üîç Notes

- `amount` must be provided in **Chilean Pesos (CLP)** as an integer (no decimal places).
- `reference_id` is a unique identifier for the transaction (used for tracking).
- `test_mode: true` indicates this is a simulated transaction.
- Set `auto_process` to `true` or `false` to control whether the transaction is processed automatically. If set to `false`, you will need to approve it manually from the dashboard.
- Additional metadata (e.g., `url`) must be included in the `metadata` object.
