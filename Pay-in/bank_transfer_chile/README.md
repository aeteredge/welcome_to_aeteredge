## 🔍 Notes

- All amounts must be provided in **Chilean Pesos (CLP)** as whole numbers (integer).
- Use `test_mode: true` to simulate transactions in a sandbox environment.
- Callback and redirect URLs must be HTTPS for secure communications.

## 🎯 Approving transactions in sandbox

When using `test_mode: true`, you can simulate different payment outcomes by setting specific values in the `amount` field:

| Test Amount    | Behavior                                    |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `99997`        | Triggers a **successful** payment callback. |
| `99999`        | Triggers a **declined** payment callback.   |
