## üîç Notes

- `amount` must be provided in **Peruvian Soles (PEN)** as an integer (no decimal places).
- `reference_id` is a unique identifier for the transaction (used for tracking).
- `test_mode: true` indicates this is a simulated transaction.
- Set `auto_process` to `true` or `false` to control whether the transaction is processed automatically. If set to `false`, you will need to approve it manually from the dashboard.
- Additional metadata (e.g., `url`) must be included in the `metadata` object.

## üéØ Approving transactions in sandbox

When using `test_mode: true`, you can simulate different payment outcomes by setting specific values in the `amount` field:

| Test Amount    | Behavior                                    |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `99997`        | Triggers a **successful** payment callback. |
| `99999`        | Triggers a **declined** payment callback.   |
