## üîç Notes

- `amount` must be provided in **Guaran√≠es (PYG)** as an integer (no decimal places).
- `reference_id` is a unique identifier for the transaction (used for tracking).
- `test_mode: true` indicates this is a simulated transaction.
- Set `auto_process` to `true` or `false` to control whether the transaction is processed automatically. If you set it as false, you will need to approve it manually from the dashboar. 
- Additional metadata (e.g., `url`) must be included in the `metadata` object.
