## üîç Notes

- All amounts must be provided in **Mexican Pesos (MXN)** as whole numbers (in cents).
- Use `test_mode: true` to simulate transactions in a sandbox environment.
- Callback and redirect URLs must use HTTPS for secure communications.
- This service creates a **payment invoice** for a bank transfer via SPEI in Mexico.

## üéØ Approving transactions in sandbox

When using `test_mode: true`, you can simulate different payment outcomes by setting specific values in the `amount` field:

| Test Amount | Behavior                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `99997`     | Triggers a **successful** payment callback. |
| `99999`     | Triggers a **declined** payment callback.   |
